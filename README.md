# Talks from our meetups

## 2024
## February @ Deliveroo
[Platforms from Prototype to Production](/2024_February/Sanyia_Saidova-Platforms_from_Prototype_to_Production.pdf) with Sanyia Saidova
> Sanya walks us through the journey of how to shape your platform to account for growth in your application - what decisions lay in your path as your userbase grows and how to weight them.

[Contract testing for the past, present and the future with Pact-Go](/2024_February/Yousaf_Nabi-Contract_testing_for_the_past_present_and_the_future_with_Pact-Go.pdf) with Yousaf Nabi
> How do we test our applications now, what are the benefits and drawbacks of each way of testing and how does integration fit into all of it. Yousaf explains it all and provides examples on how to start contract testing with Go and Pact.

## 2023
## September @ Elastic
[Go-ing Gopher Hunting with Elasticsearch and Go](/2023_September/Carly_Richmond-Gopher_Hunting_Elasticsearch.pdf) with Carly Richmond
> With the explosion of Large Language Models and the emergence of ChatGPT, how we search for data is evolving. In this talk, Carly will walk through traditional keyword, vector and hybrid search, and how to find information with each approach using Elasticsearch and Go.

[Production-ready Hello World!](/2023_September/Daniela_Petruzalek-Hello_World.pdf) with Daniela Petruzalek
> As software engineers, most of the time we are focusing on delivering the task that is given to us. If someone asks us to do a hello world API we can do it in 4, maybe 5 lines of Go code. But would that code be production ready? What does production ready code actually look like? In this talk, we are going to implement a “hello world” API, but focusing on all the aspects that would make this code production-ready, including documentation, logging, error handling, configuration, naming, code organization, testing and others.

## August @ Acre
[The Three Ages of Go Concurrency](/2023_August/Lula_Leus-Concurrency_talk.pdf) with Lula Leus
> The talk is a fusion of light-touch theory on a subset of Go concurrency primitives and a case study of a real-world code example written by the author for her workplace. The inclusion of the ‘Three Ages of Man’ painting and artistic references throughout the talk adds vibrancy and aids in understanding the complex and often dry topic of concurrency.

[Testing strategies for microservice architectures](/2023_August/Adelina_Simion-Testing_strategies.pdf) with Adelina Simion
> Experienced developers know that a comprehensive testing strategy is vital to a healthy microservice architecture. However, as the system grows and changes without any central oversight, the complexity of our test scenarios dramatically
